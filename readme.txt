I have written this as how normal ls command would be like
With no flags. If it starts with no inputs, it will display
Current dir, with a given dir, it will display that one.
If dir is not found it will return err.


as for the second part of the lab, i think i have failed to
do multiple files. maybe i need to make a 2d array to store
all the files and ...well its a bit too hard for me now.
I will think about what to do later.
